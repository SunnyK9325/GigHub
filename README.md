# GigHub  
– Developed a freelancing web application using the MERN stack, enabling user registration as sellers or regular users. Sellers can create and delete gigs, while users can explore, purchase, and review gigs they have purchased. Order tracking is available on the orders page.  
  
– The front end is built using React.js, styled with Sassy CSS (SASS) for a clean and efficient design.
  
– Implemented a RESTful API with Express.js, integrated with MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval.
  
– Incorporated a secure user authentication system integrating JSON Web Tokens (JWT), cookies, and bcrypt encryption for enhanced password security within the MongoDB database.  
  
– Employed technologies such as React Axios for seamless data fetching and requests, React Router for navigation, and React Query for efficient search queries. Integrated Stripe for secure gig order processing.
