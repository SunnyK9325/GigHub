}

// The * is a wildcard selector that targets all elements.
// The .link selector is nested within the * selector. 
// This means that the styles specified inside .link will apply to any element with the class "link" that is a 
// descendant of any other element on the page.

// When you import a SCSS file in a React component (e.g., app.jsx), and that component is rendered at the top level of your application, 
// the styles defined in the SCSS file will be applied to all child components as well.
